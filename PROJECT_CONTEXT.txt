Project Context and Goals
-------------------------

Project: Comparing Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots repositories.

Objective:
- Analyze code differences between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots based on Git tags.
- Focus on meaningful changes, ignoring purely cosmetic differences (formatting, whitespace, line endings, etc.).
- Understand which changes affect functionality, rather than merely file hashes.

Environment:
- Language: C++20
- Tools: Git, libgit2
- Platform: macOS and Raspberry Pi Linux

Notes:
- Modified files may show as different due to hashing differences even if textual content is identical.
- Goal is to filter out these non-functional changes and isolate true code modifications.
- Future work includes automating the comparison using libgit2 and handling tag-based diffs effectively.

Reminder:
- When resuming, start by recalling the focus on meaningful differences and ignoring cosmetic modifications.
